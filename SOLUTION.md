In fact, I think 3 hours was not enough time, because I had some innovations in my mind and I could not apply them. For example, the user can fondly remember the payment they want, in addition, I was thinking of applying filtering by date. In addition, the graphics you applied to the design were often not customer-oriented. Instead, if we add a graph by month and amount, the customer can see which month he paid more.

My other opinion is that when you look at the details of each payment, it may be more customer-oriented for the customer to see other payments below. And in this case, there is no need for the search field that you added, in my opinion, if I had 5 hours, I could apply all of them.

I suggest that sometimes a developer encounters unwanted bugs and can't solve it at that moment, no matter how hard he tries, I hope you will take that situation into account. I had a problem with many bugs and libraries for 3 hours, maybe that's why I didn't have time.
